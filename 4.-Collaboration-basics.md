### Understanding pull
```
$ git pull
```
1. **Fetch** (or Sync) our local repository with the remote one `$ git fetch`
Fetch doesn't actually update any of our local code.

> `$ git fetch origin`
>
> git fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository.
Due to it's "harmless" nature, you can rest assured: fetch will never manipulate, destroy, or screw up anything. This means you can never fetch often enough

2. **Merges** the origin/master with master `$ git merge origin/master`
```
master
  <*>  <- merge commit
   |  \
   |   \
  <*>  <*> origin/master
   |   /
   |  /
  <*>
   |
```
### To store credentials on disk
```
$ git config credential.helper store
```
Example:
```
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>
```
### Merge conflict
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
the cake is a lie.             <- Our local version
=======
the cake is telling the truth! <- Version on server
>>>>>>>
...
```
```
$ git commit -a    <- Merge commit
$ git push
```
