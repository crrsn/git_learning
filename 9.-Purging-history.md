### Resons not to rewrite history:
* Your data is already compromised.
* Everyone must update their work to reflect your revised commits.

### When you should do it anyway:
* Committed files violate someone's copyright.
* Large binary files are making your repo too big.
* You're rewriting commits that haven't been made public.

### You can lose work when you're rewriting history!

Clone it first.
```
$ git clone petshop petshop-filter
Cloning into 'petshop-filter'...
done

$ cd petshop-filter
```
### TREE FILTER
```
$ git filter-branch --tree-filte> <command> ...
```
`<command>` - any shell command. Git will check each commit out into working directory, run your command, and re-commit.

**Example:**
```
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' --prune-empty -- --all
```
`--tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt'` - Remove "passwords.txt" from project root
`--all` - filter all commits in **all branches**

`HEAD` - filter only **current branch**

`-f` - doesn't fail if file isn't present
