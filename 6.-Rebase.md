### Merge commits are bad
```
master
  <*>  <- merge commit
   |  \
   |   \
  <*>  <*> origin/master
   |   /
   |  /
  <*>
   |
```
**Merge commits feel useless**
### Rebase
```
$ git fetch      <- Syncs but doesn't merge
```
```
master  origin/master
  (a)  (c)
   |  /
   | / 
  (b)
   |
```
```
$ git rebase
```
1. Move all changes to **master** which are not in **origin/master** to a temporary area.
2. Run all **origin/master** commits
3. Run all commits in the temporary area, one at a time.
```
  master

   (a)  From master
    |
   (c)  From origin/master
    |
   (b)
    |
```
**No merge commit!**
### Local branch rebase
```
$ git checkout admin
  Switched to branch 'admin'
$ git rebase master
```
```
  master     admin
    |          |
    |         (a)
    |          |
   (b)         |
    |          |
    |         (c) 
    |          |
   (d)         |
    |         /
    |        /
       ...
    | /
    |/
    |
    |
```
