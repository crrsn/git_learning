### Merge commits are bad
```
master
  <*>  <- merge commit
   |  \
   |   \
  <*>  <*> origin/master
   |   /
   |  /
  <*>
   |
```
**Merge commits feel useless**
### Rebase
```
$ git fetch      <- Syncs but doesn't merge
```
```
master  origin/master
  (*)  (*)
   |  /
   | / 
  (*)
   |
```
```
$ git rebase
```
1. Move all changes to **master** which are not in **origin/master** to a temporary area.
