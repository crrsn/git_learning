### Creating a remote branch
```
$ git checkout -b shopping_cart   <- Switched to a new branch 'shopping cart'
$ git push origin shopping_cart   <- Links local branch to the remote branch (tracking)
```
Then
```
$ git add cart.rb
$ git commit -a -m "Add basics cart ability"
$ git push   <- Pushed changes from branch shopping_cart
```
### Pulling new branch
```
$ git branch
  * master
```
```
$ git branch -r  <- list all remote branches
  origin/master
  origin/shopping_cart
```
```
$ git checkout shopping_cart
  Branch shopping_cart set up to track remote branch shopping_cart from origin.
  Switched to a new branch 'shopping_cart'
```
```
$ git branch
    master
  * shopping_cart
```

```
$ git remote show origin
```
### Removing a branch
```
$ git push origin :shopping_cart    <- Deletes remote branch
```
```
$ git branch -d shopping_cart       <- Must delete local branch manually
  error: The branch 'shopping_cart' is not fully merged.
  If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D shopping_cart'.
```
```
$ git branch -D shopping_cart
